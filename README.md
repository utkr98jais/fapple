# fapple : Fapp your password
iTunes encrypted backup brute force password checker

This tool automates checking a list of passwords for the iTunes encrypted backup password, with a license restricting use
solely to phones that are owned by the user.  I had to write it, because Apple's encrypted backup feature suffers a design flaw.  

The encryption process they built, uses a database on the iphone.  Once you turn the iTunes encryption feature on,
if you forget your password, it doesn't just render your old backups useless (like it should), it forces any new backups
to exclusively be a) encrypted and b) use the old, forgotten, password.  Reseting this, requires a 
[device wipe](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT203790), or jailbreaking.  Which, is rediculous, 
because what person **wouldn't want to make a backup before wiping their device?**

The good news, is that this wasn't the only flaw in their design.  Their password checking tool, also suffers a flaw.
It will let you try infinite passwords. 

## Barely complete!

I wrote this tool, in less than an hour and a single commit. So, it's barely complete.  
But, it's functional and worked for me.  It found my password after trying a list of 
960 possible passwords which I gave (read: I had knowledge of permutations about my own passwords)
it to start with.

### Incomplete Virtual Keyboard Map
This process took a material amount of time, but it worked.  The virtual keyboard map is an incomplete
dictionary.  The dictionary needs to be completed, for this tool to work on passwords with non-alpha numeric symbols.
I'll complete the dictionary, if somebody paypals $200 to jeffrey.mclarty@gmail.com.

### Timings
The timings are sloppy.  They could be tightened up.  Like I said; I wrote this tool in less than an hour.

## Usage

1. Have a list of passwords you want to try, assign them to the candidates variable in passlist.py
2. Assign something to the newpassword variable in bforcer.py
3. Turn on itunes.
4. Calibrate mouse positions.
    Use getcurpos.py to get the x & y coordinates of thethree buttons and one text field, 
    in iTunes that one would click while trying a password.  
    
    Set them, in bforcer.py.  The four variables are:
    
    * ChangePassworddotdotdot
    * ChangePassword
    * OK
    * OldPassword
5. Run bforcer.py
6. Wait. 

## Support?

This tool is unsupported.  See the license.  Don't e-mail me unless you have lots of money and will give me some.
